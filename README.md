# n0repe4ts
---
As a kneejerk to a post I read I decided to throw this together for shits & giggles.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/scs-labrat/n0repe4ts.git
cd n0repe4ts
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Copy password lists to n0repe4ts directory.  The program will iterate through, removing duplicates then rename password textfiles in order of size.  These can then be piped into whatever bruteforcing tool you wish with the knowledge that you will never be retrying a used password.
